<h2 align="center">Why this community</h2>

We as developers, freelancers and contributors spend a lot of time searching for resources that could work better for different use cases in our project. I did a survey a while ago to see **"Max to max, How much overall time do have spend searching for resources and tools that best suit your project, your workflows!?"**

Found that more than 40% developers spend more than 1-2 hours just on searching for resources and tools for their workflows. So we decide to collect the **most hardly searched** and the best resources from the community that could make it easier for others fellow folks.

<!-- <h2 align="center">Our Pledge</h2>
